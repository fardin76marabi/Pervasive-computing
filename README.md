It was a university project during my master study that related to implementing a proposed method of a paper called DPTO into python. It was a delay dependent priority-aware task offloading (DPTO) strategy for the tasks in a fog-cloud environment. The primary goal of the strategy was to schedule the tasks based on their priority and offload them to the suitable computing devices for minimizing the delay while meeting the deadlines.
